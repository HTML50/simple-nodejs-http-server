# simple-nodejs-http-server

a simple http server for node.js. 



# what's the difference

you can arrive at the default page (index.html) without specifying it.

eg, you can go with`http://localhost/test`, and you will get `http://localhost/test/index.html`

I googled and found no solution, so I made this for my test.
